This package is a set of example shell and gnuplot scripts to create
the JPAC example plots. The JPAC colors are defined in 'jpac.pal',
and must be loaded into any gnuplot script. The gnuplot scripts
'jpac_2dplot.plt' and 'jpac_3dplot.plt' make the 2d and 3d plots respectively.
To create the plots, execute the script file 'create_plots.sh'.
These plots are created as pdf files and stored in the 'figs' directory.
For the 2d plot, the gnuplot script requires data, which are stored in the
'data' directory.

If there are any questions on these scripts and how they work/ how they are
set up, please let me know. If there are any questions on how to extend these
scripts to more complicated cases, I am happy to help.

If anyone has ideas on how to make these scripts more versatile, please
let me know as I am interested in making these scripts more robust.
